## **Why the need for indicommunity?**

## **What is the use of blockchain in indicoin?**

Traditionally, it falls upon the government to collect taxes, manipulate currency supply and fund projects that the society needs.
For this, the society elects representatives that make decisions on their behalf, chosing how much taxes to collect from which transactions,
how much money to inject into the economy and which projects to fund.

Indicoin aims to fullfill this very role, but with much needed infrastructure updates to the decision making, value tracking,
smart currency incentives structured for constructive participation and accountability.

Using the breakthrough technology of blockchain, we have a public ledger to handle accountability of social resources providing radical
trust to the indicommunity members without depending on representatives to be honest, accountable and super-smart with their decision making.
This could not be done without the blockchain providing the trustable secure ledger for all to rely upon. Using this new standard in IT,
we can now create programmable and customisable currencies which can be more reliable, convenient, trustable and inclusive.

Blockchain offers:
- uncensorable decentralisation
- transparency
- openness
- incentivisation
- accountability

If these mean something to you, then participate in the making of the Indicoin. Indicoin is not a get rich quick scheme. It is a 
cryptocurrency designed for social service. Selling valuable tokens at a cheap price through ICO is required for building an open access community
which participates in the development of indicoin. As the project progresses through contributions of indicoin holders,
indicoins gain in value and everyone in the community profits as the tokens come closer to realisation of its true potential.
